### Motivation

When I was a student at the University of Guelph, we learned how to program in assembly using a simulator of the Motorola 68000. The only problem was that the tool we used was windows specific, and quite old. I felt like exposing myself to some more web technologies, and I also felt like docker was a good way to make it easily accessible to all students - mainly because it is a technology that they are already exposed to at the University of Guelph.
